Main description: Greetings $N. It is good that you are here. It appears that we have a delicate situation on our hands. A few days ago, we received an urgent message from Dalaran requesting an emergency meeting in Stormwind. \n\n I do not doubt that whatever this meeting is for, it will be of great importance, which is why I want you there with me. You have already proven to be a great diplomat and a friend. The meeting is supposed to occur in Stormwind Embassy in the Dwarven District. Please make haste there and speak to the Clerk once you arrive.
Short objective: Attend the meeting in the Stormwind Embassy 0/1
Return to Vereesa Windrunner in Alah'thalas 0/1
Progress text: Yes $N?
Completion: I had hoped that our people would finally have peace and time to rebuild, but this is not something we can ignore. When the time comes for us to depart, I will call upon you, but it may come sooner than we expect. Together we have accomplished much, but what we face now will undoubtedly be far more dangerous than anything we had encountered before. That is why I was hoping you could assist with establishing the landing site $N. No one in my mind is more capable of seeing this campaign through than you, my friend. I hope we can count on you.

Additional notes: Upon speaking to the Clerk in the Embassy, a meeting will begin.
The leaders will all appear in the Embassy. Bolvar, Magni, Tyrande, Vereesa, Jaina, and Mekkatorque.
Lastly, a High elf called Ambassador Kelayah (Display 17641) will appear. 
Meeting
Bolvar: We have convened, as you requested, ambassador.
Kelayah: Thank you Highlord Fordragon. I am grateful for everyone's quick arrival.
Tyrande: I have not come here for idle pleasantries. What was so urgent that you need all of us here?
Kelayah: Yes, High Priestess, we have more than troubling news. Our Arcane Observatories have detected that the remains of Sunwell have become active again. And we believe it is responsible for the corruption afflicting the Plaguelands and Quel'thalas. In fact... Corruption is starting to spread rapidly.
Vereesa: What?!
Kelayah: The situation was far worse than we initially thought. We sent a number of our agents to investigate the Sunwell's reemerging energies in Northern Quel'Thalas, but very few made it out alive. Those who did make it got us the intelligence we required. It isn't going to stop on its own. If we do not stop the Sunwell, all of Azeroth may perish within a few years.
Magni: Are you sure of this lass? We need a wee bit more details if we are to put a stop to it.
Kelayah: I'm afraid I have some, but it's not good. Our scouts also reported fel signature and demons being present around Silvermoon, but we do not know if they're responsible.
Tyrande scowls in anger.
Tyrande: So the sins of the past come to haunt the Highborne... And some choose to side with demons as well...Unthinkable.
Vereesa: Whatever the sins of my ancestors are, our priority right now is to save this world and all of its people.
Tyrande: May I remind you that a large chunk of the world is in ruins because of your ancestors. And your ancestors betrayed us when we showed them mercy and set Ashenvale alight with destructive Arcane!
Bolvar: High Priestess, please. Vereesa's people are not her ancestors. If Sunwell is about to corrupt the entire world, we cannot afford to fight between ourselves. 
Jaina: We all have blood on our hands. But we stood together at the Hyjal to banish the Legion once before. Though it came at great cost, together we succeeded. If we are to prevent the Legion from returning, then we must work together. 
Tyrande nods silently, seeming to back off.
Jaina: I will warn the Horde. I am sure that Thrall will understand the gravity of this situation.
Jaina: Thrall will ensure peace as long as we share a common goal, I am sure of it.
Bolvar: I hope your faith is not misplaced, Lady Proudmoore. Regardless, we cannot rely on the Horde for this.
Mekkatorque: Agreed! We need our own plan. Having the Horde on our side would increase our chances of winning, but relying on the Horde is too unpredictable.
Tyrande: Perhaps I acted hastily earlier, but we cannot allow the corruption of the Undead to spread. We must act now and stop this vile Sunwell!
Vereesa: My people want more than anything to retake our homeland, but can we afford an attack on Quel'Thalas? Ignoring the Undead and going straight for the Sunwell is suicidal. Not to mention there are demons too.
 Tyrande: Some of you have experienced the power of the Legion firsthand and should know that should they come back, the Undead would be the least of our problems. If anything stands in our way, we must fight through it to stop both the Sunwell and the Demons. 
Mekkatorque: Correct, but our forces are already stretched thin as it is, and a direct assault will be costly.
Bolvar: Just so, our lands are beset with strife, and I am sure Lady Windrunner is in no position to commit much either. Regardless we cannot ignore this. Everyone must put forth what they can afford to.
Jaina: I am sure Thrall would not ignore the possibility of that corruption spreading globally. If we can make a truce with the Horde, it should work out as long as we stay out of each other's way and focus on the enemy. Magni: Whatever we do, we need a landing site. Once we secure the landing, the rest of the Alliance forces can move in.
Tyrande: My people will establish the beachhead and lead the efforts. We cannot afford to let those demon worshippers or the corrupted Sunwell continue. 
Vereesa: We will be right there with you, Quel'Thalas is my home, and although our numbers are few, the Quel'dorei will not let even the Sunwell defile more of it.
Jaina: Then Theramore will provide ships and what troops we can, but the battle for a landing site will be harsh.
Tyrande: Then it is settled. I will rouse the Sentinels and prepare our fleet. 
Mekkatorque: Any ideas where we would land our forces?
Vereesa: We could try landing on Shalandis Isle. It is relatively close to the coast and surrounded by water, making it an excellent defensible position.
Tyrande: So be it. Your knowledge of the terrain will prove invaluable, Lady Windrunner. I expect a full report.
Bolvar: It is decided then, while our initial invasion force deals with taking and fortifying Shalandis Isle, the rest of us will muster and mobilize our forces. Once we arrive, the campaign for Quel'thalas can begin. Are all in favor of this plan?
Magni: Aye
Vereesa: Yes.
Jaina: Indeed.
Mekkatorque: Affirmative.
Tyrande: We are. 
Bolvar: Then it is settled. Ambassador, we will be expecting all the intel you can provide. We cannot afford to fail.
Kelayah:  Due to Dalaran's current situation, intelligence, supplies and very limited manpower is all we can spare. But we will give as much as we can to ensure this operation goes smoothly.
Vereesa: Then let us return home to prepare.
Bolvar: Agreed. This meeting is adjourned. Good luck to us all, and may the Light guide us.
