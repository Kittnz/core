details = 'Hey... uhm, excuse me, I have a request for you!\n\nHah, I\'ve said it! It makes me so nervous to approach people leaving the abbey, but it\'s the only way I can possibly get my wish fulfilled.\n\nOh, the request, of course! You see, I love visiting Stormwind when I go to trade at Gallina Winery and I always walk past the trade district fountain, which is right next to the bank.\n\nCould you toss a coin of mine into the fountain for good luck? I\'ve heard that if you drop a coin into the fountain, your wish might get granted, and my wish is to visit Stormwind again as soon as possible!\n\nOne more thing, please send my greetings to Suzetta Gallina!',
