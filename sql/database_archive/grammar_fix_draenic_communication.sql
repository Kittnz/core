update quest_template set details = 'Akh Z\'ador is a Riftseeker who led us to this world. He was one of the few of our kind that knew the magic of our ancient ancestors. He was skilled enough to bring our entire tribe here, and that of the Fallow Sanctuary, with the help of the other lesser Riftseekers.\n\nA few weeks ago, he attempted to return to the old world in search of more exiles to bring to the Harborage. I suspect something went terribly wrong, for I could not detect his presence upon our old world with the Sanv Charm. You see, the magic he is using is old, and somewhat unstable. We barely understand its usage, and only the bright minds like Akh Z\'ador can manipulate it enough to travel.\n\nI need you to gather materials in order to cast a spell to find his location and see perhaps where it is he has gone. Local materials should work just fine. Gather six Tangled Essence from the Tangled Horrors to the east, and a Marsh-Murloc Eye from Murlocs at the coast.' where entry = 40032;
