-- The Shadow Well
update quest_template set details = 'I have already sent my serv... assistant Thalo down there, but he has yet to return. It could prove valuable to know more about it if this Shadow Well is as powerful and dangerous as this text claims.', requestitemstext = 'You are back!? That is... good. Tell me, what did you find down there?', offerrewardtext = 'If you didn\'t find Thalo, it must mean that the skeleton was his. Oh well. And what is this about black slimes emerging from the well\'s waters? So they were right, most intriguing.\n\nAnyways, your help here is appreciated, but I think it\'s high time for you to leave. I still have research to do here, and you should inform Arcanist about our findings here, should you not?' where entry = 80291;
