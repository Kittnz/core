-- A Bad Day to Fish!
update quest_template set details = 'The Southfury River wasn\'t always so bad, not when we first settled here. The floods and rough waters made for a test of will against the natural forces of our new home, but something has changed recently that caused a massive increase in crocolisks!\n\nAll I want to do is fish all day, but now I have to fight off beasts and spend more time with a weapon in hand than enjoying my fishing spot.\n\nBefore you ask, I\'ve done enough fighting for one lifetime from the siege of Durnholde to the battle of Mt. Hyjal. I just want to relax and contribute this way. Go out and secure my fishing spot and I\'ll give you one of my handcrafted fishing rods.', requestitemstext = 'Have you had any trouble?
