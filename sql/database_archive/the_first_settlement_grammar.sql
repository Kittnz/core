-- The First Settlement
update quest_template set details = 'Ah, there you are, $N. You have proven to be of some use in the past. I have observed that you have an uncanny knack for running errands. My ancestors were exiled from Kalimdor seven thousand years ago, but you\'re mistaken if you think they created Quel\'thalas right away.\n\nThey landed in what is today known as the Tirisfal Glades. According to records left behind in Alah\'thalas, the first settlement was known as Ishnu\'danil. Naturally, this is something we consider worthy of exploring further, which is why I have sent my subordinate Thas\'alah to investigate this ancient location.\n\nHowever, I have not heard a word from him since, and to make matters worse, the records we found mention a curse of some kind that affected the minds of our ancestors who lived there. I need you to go there and find out what became of Thas\'alah.', requestitemstext = 'Who are you, $r?', offerrewardtext = 'Arcanist Anu\'delen sent you? Finally, some goods news, this damned expedition has just been one disaster after another. We made progress at first but not long after, everything went downhill.\n\nOur equipment broke, people thought the place was haunted, and some even claimed that they heard voices talking to them. But that last one is nonsense, I assure you.' where entry = 80289;
