In my tent, my shoes, my armor, always more scorpids! They\'re more of a nuisance to me than a real danger, but each time I get stung I have to drink a healing potion or head back to town for help. I’m sick of it!\n\nI\'m nursing my latest sting right now, but you look like you’re up to the task of a hunt. Head out and kill every scorpid you find!
