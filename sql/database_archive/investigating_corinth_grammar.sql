details = 'It would seem the Corinth family once held quite a few connections with both Lordaeron and the Stormwind Nobles.\n\nAll of them have died but Martin still remained, and fled to Stormwind after the war. According to some of these documents as part of his exile he was intending on heading to Menethil Harbor to settle there, we know this is not the case, but perhaps he had left something for us to find.\n\nSpeak with the innkeeper in Menethil Harbor, ask if they had seen Martin Corinth or Harlus Ashbuckle.'
