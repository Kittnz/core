-- Inner Binding Purification

Bring five Liferoot, ten Solid Stones, and three Wild Steelblooms to the speaker.\n\nThen we will be able to begin the ritual to cleanse the bracers. Once done, the Wildtusk will be able to offer my kind safe haven from the dark forces that drive us to madness and they will stand protected from future invaders.', requestitemstext = 'The task at hand is an important one.
