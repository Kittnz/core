It would appear they are quite... ravenous these days.$B$BI am Lord Ebonlocke of Darkshire. I traveled here of my own accord and have not returned since. I am quite aware of my current state in the tower, for I have been dead for some time. Most others that linger here are not as keen, unfortunately. It would appear that I am cursed to haunt these halls until something most fortuitous should free me from this eternal confinement.$B$BPerhaps we can help one another. I have come to learn a few things and meet others in a similar situation to mine during the time I have been bound here.' where entry = 61255;
