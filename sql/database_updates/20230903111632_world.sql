Centuries ago, a battle unfolded upon this very hill, where the forces of Gilneas, against all odds, triumphed over Arathor. I am convinced that the key to their triumph lay buried within these grounds, and the Regent\'s bloodlust coveted this dormant power for their own malevolent purposes.$B$BWe must delve deep into this mystery. Unearthing such power would bestow upon us a formidable advantage. I shall sift through these weathered tomes, unearthing knowledge that may shed light on our quarry.$B$BIn the interim, I ask you to embark on a perilous journey to Desolace.
