My people have begun making the journey from the old world to set up a new home here in Kalimdor.\n\nIt will be far away from the forests of Lordaeron, but the threat of Hakkar\'s worshippers and the Wildhammer can no longer be fended off.\n\nWe\'ve been running into some difficulties settling in and if you can spare the time, we could use your help.\n\nFind Deino in Orgrimmar, a mage trainer in the Valley of Spirits.', requestitemstext = 'What brings you here?', offerrewardtext = 'Sent by the Revantusk? They came to Kalimdor a few months ago and constructed a village in the hills of the Stonetalon Mountains under the order of Primal Torntusk.\n\nEstablishing a new home for yourself after struggling for so long is no easy task, one that the Darkspear sympathize with. When you\'re ready, I\'ll send you to Tal\'revan so you can see how you can best be useful. I just hope the rest of them make the journey before it\'s too late.' where entry = 80300;
