Well, the only gnolls I know that camp not so far away from here are the Riverpaw Gnolls. They are the leftovers of a tribe led by a mighty gnoll known all over Elwynn – Fedfennel.\n\nRumor has it he\'s been eaten by his own rivals. I digress, however. The camp is most likely further up to the north from Stone Cairn Lake.\n\nI heard that even our brave guards dare not to go that far in the forest. Perhaps, while you\'re at the searching campaign for stolen pumpkins, you could help the Eastvale Logging Camp as well?\n\nThese gnolls won\'t be willing to part that easily with what they\'ve stolen, so I assume you\'ll have to claw it out of their dead cold paws.\n\nDo us all good and cull out s\'more of these bastards while you\'re there? One brigade less and we\'ll have a week of sound sleep by nights.', offerrewardtext = 'You did what? All by yourself?!\n\nWell, that\'s great news!
