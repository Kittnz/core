update quest_template set details = 'As a Druid of the Antler, we have dedicated our lives to Malorne, the White Stag that reached the moon. Ours is the path of love and tenacity.\n\nLong ago, when Azeroth was born and the first nightfall covered its lands, Elune shone through the dark night’s sky with a light so bright that it struck the heart of the White Stag, Malorne. During his travels in the woods, Elune guided him with her light, banishing the fear of the dark and bringing hope into his soul. Night after night he pursued her light, each time growing faster and stronger until the day he reached the skies.\n\nImpressed by his tenacity and the love he carried for her, Elune decided to make Malorne her consort. Not long after, our lord Cenarius was born of their love. This is the story as it was told for generations, which you must know if you desire to assume the form of the White Stag.' where entry = 40012;

update quest_template set details = 'When the world was young and the Shu\’halo rose from the golden mists of the dawn, the Earthmother blessed us with the love of the hunt. The creatures of the first dawn were fierce and savage. They hid from the Earthmother\’s sight, finding solace in the shadows and the wilds. Our ancestors hunted these mighty beasts and tamed them with the Earthmother\’s blessing.\n\nApa\’ro, the White Stag, with fur as white as the purest of snow, antlers that pierced the sky, and hooves that shook the land itself, eluded the hunters of our ancestors. For many nights our ancestors hunted him across the plains and to the ends of the earth. To flee, the great stag leapt into the sky, but his mighty antlers were tangled in the stars. He struggled to no avail. It was in that moment then that he was noticed by Mu\'sha as she chased after her brother, An\’she, across the heavens. She found him and at first glance fell in love with him.\n\nThe clever moon made a bargain with the proud stag: if he were to end her loneliness and dedicate his love to him, she would set him free. Many moons later, from their love the demi-god, Cenarius, was born. Cenarius was meant to walk the starry path between the waking world and the kingdom of the heavens. As a Druid of the Antler, I and many other were touched by the tenacity of Apa\'ro and the love he held for both the wilds and Mu\’sha. The story I have shared with you was passed from each generation to share with those who would choose to walk the path of the White Stag.' where entry = 40013;
