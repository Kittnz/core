UPDATE `quest_template` SET `Details`='This gonna be the last task I’m giving you, champ. You better be ready, ‘cause if you’re not, you won’t come back breathing.\n\nOur partners, the orcs, call these babies Armored Scorpions. This beast’s quick on its tiny feet, and their carapace is light yet durable if that wasn’t clear enough when I said “armored”. And they got a deadly sting, so if you get your hands one of these pups, you won’t have to worry about getting pushed around anymore, ever.\n\nWhen you get back, I’m gonna show you my skills. Let me tell you, pal, these skills are beyond mad!\n\nYou will be able to tame whatever beast you want. All you need is the right amount of confidence and animals will eat it up. It won’t be long before they’ll be treating you as their master.\n\nThe beasts you tame will grow with you, kid, and you’ll become a fearsome duo. I’m gonna also teach you how to call them in or send them out.';
