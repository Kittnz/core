-- Fix typo in description of quest They Call Themselves Illidari.
UPDATE `quest_template` SET `Details`='My scouts have reported activity east of the Shatter Scar Vale, close to what my people call the Shrine of the Betrayer. It is a cold statue of Illidan Stormrage, a name with a heavy impact on our history. Not many dare to speak out loud about him, but I feel no fear in mentioning the name of a being that no longer inhabits these lands.$B$BRegardless, this is not a history lesson. At the foot of this statue, a group of sin\'dorei has settled. Perhaps they fled Azshara, or were simply in hiding for this long. I remember the High Priestess aiding these mongrels who remind me of the reign of Azshara, but she was clearly mistaken.$B$BThey call themselves the Illidari, and to me, they have simply sealed their fate by foolishly admitting their connection to the Betrayer. We need to cull their numbers. These woods are already infected, and we cannot afford any more plague.' WHERE `entry`=40776;
