We must deal with them now with due haste in our actions.\n\nJust south of here is Lake Mennar where the Blue Dragonflight has gathered. The cause of which was unknown until now. Head there, slay their Magelords, and kill the leader, Lieutenant Azsalus. Report back to me once you were able to shatter them. \n\nOne more thing... The Blue Dragonflight is not a foe to be underestimated. I would advise you to find a band of mercenaries or like-minded heroes. You will need them to battle with the dragonkin, or at least to stand a chance.' WHERE entry = 40127;
