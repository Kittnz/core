update quest_template set details = 'It\'s clear to me that Prince Greymane seeks aid from my research group. I am afraid he must\'ve misunderstood us, however, as we do not intend to reach immortality. Rather, we seek power and healthiness beyond what the human body is capable of. I assume you\'ve already figured out our little secret. If not, let me put this as bluntly as possible: we have accepted the worgen curse.$B$BWe are more than willing to aid Liam in reclaiming his city and his lands; our alchemical knowledge, our teeth, and our latent power are all at his disposal.$B$BWe have yet to have full control of our abilities, but I think I have discovered a way to aid in that regard. Travel northwest to the Dryrock Valley and kill as many of the traitorous ones as possible. Drain their blood and bring it back to me. It will play an important part in our research.' where entry = 40953;
