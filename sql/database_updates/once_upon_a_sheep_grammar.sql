I can\'t run a farm without sheep to shear. These varmint wolves have been scaring my sheep away for too long. I\'m sick and tired of it! Now they\'re scattered around Elwynn, scared and shaking in their expensive fleece.\n\nWithout sheep, I\'ve got no way to support this farm or my daughter, Julie. I use their wool to make everything from handbags to hoods, but times have been tough lately. Say, you\'re a strong-lookin\' feller. Why don\'t you wrangle \'em back for me? You\'ll be doing me a mighty fine favor. I\'ll give you a fair shake in return.\n\nJulie made a batch of their favorite treats.
