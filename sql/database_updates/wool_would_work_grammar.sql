-- Wool Would Work

Each day gets a little colder without her, but she taught me everything she knew about making woolen garments.\n\nAs you can see, the farm\'s been losing sheep left and right. There\'s plenty out in the forest though, but it\'s too dangerous for me. Papa can\'t lose me and Ma bothâ€”then he\'d be stuck with poor ol\' Lulu.\n\nGather a few bundles of wool so that I can make Papa warm clothes for the season, and I\'ll craft up a lil\' something for you, too.', requestitemstext = 'Don\'t dilly-dally for too long.
