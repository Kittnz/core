Good work.\n\nOn the other hand, the reported killing of Paval Reethe by our soldiers is troubling. Deeply troubling. I cannot just trust the Horde on this. My role, as a captain, is not only to order, but also to serve.\n\nI\'m worried that Lieutenant Caldwell only acted in his self defence. But, if the orc was really speaking the truth, you may find some evidence in Caldwell\'s belongings. You can find his quarters downstairs. He was sent there with a soldier named Hallan. Check hers, too.\n\nI will prepare the report for Lady Jaina.' WHERE `entry` = 40559;
