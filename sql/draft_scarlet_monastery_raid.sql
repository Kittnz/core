-- Scarlet Monastery (raid) introduction.

-- Sally Whitemane is dead. Confused, scattered and some even in panic, Scarlet Fanatics were laying low. Many died in attempts to continue their struggles but without a strong command leading their effort failed. However, week by week, Scarlets had reinstated their structure, and scouting groups that were mercilessly murdering every non-human being started to succeed in their crazy mission. Looks like the new leader of the Scarlet Crusade has ambitions protruding further than just instinct of other races in Azeroth: multiple human settlements had been reporting of strangers appearing in their towns speaking to the young and trying to spread their influence over their minds. 

-- Alliance attunement.
