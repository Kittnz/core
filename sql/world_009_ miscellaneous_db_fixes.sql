Well, the only gnolls I know that camp not so far away from here is the Riverpaw Gnolls. You could say it\'s the leftovers of once mighty gnoll known to whole Elwynn â€“ Fedfennel.\n\nMost likely he\'s been eaten by his own rivals. I digress however. Most likely it\'s further up to the north from Stone Cairn Lake. I heard that even our brave guards dare not to go that far in the forest. Perhaps, while you\'re at the searching campaign for stolen pumpkins, you could help the Eastvale Logging Camp as well?\n\nThese gnolls won\'t be willing to part that easily with what they\'ve stolen, so I assume you\'ll have to claw it out of their dead cold paws. Do us all good and cull out s\'more of these bastards while there? One brigade less and we\'ll have a week of sound sleep by nights. I bet Supervisor Raelen will be glad to hear of your deeds and most certainly will have something to reward you with.' where entry = 60042;
