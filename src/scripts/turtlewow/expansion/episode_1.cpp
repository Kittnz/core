I am Caledra Dawnbreeze, formerly a Ranger-Captain of the Farstriders during the Second war, but now merely a citizen of Stormwind. After the loss of Quel\'thalas our people suffered deeply due to our addiction to magic...Some of us led by our former Prince Kael\'thas were seduced by dark magic and from what I\'ve heard they betrayed the Alliance siding with the creatures known as the Naga and left.");

A few months ago, I've managed to gather representatives of our people from all outlying settlements such as the Farstrider lodges.");
        pCreature->MonsterSay("We've had a meeting where we agreed that the time has come for our people to come together so that we may create a home for ourselves where we could rebuild our people in time, a military lodge or cities belonging to other races simply isn't the way to rebuild.");

The crystal will not last forever but it will buy us time to find a cure. Our Scouts have managed to find the site, and they've confirmed that it is intact. Our people has begun to settle the Outpost and they have named it Alah'thalas, the Land of Light in our tongue.");

Likewise the local mine has been infested with creatures...In other words, any help you provide would be greatly appreciated!");
